As part of my responsibility as a research intern at the Cyberinfrastructure for Network Science Center (CNS), I learn about and make data visualizations. My goal with these visualizations is to clearly illustrate data to aid in its interpretation. Some examples of my work are shown below.


#### Humanexus Map



[Humanexus](http://yfshen.info/humanexus/)is a short film about human communication throughout the ages produced by CNS's director, Katy Borner. The map I made is a geospatial and topical visualization of all the film's showings. The location of each node tells where in the world a Humanexus showing occurred, and the color of each node denotes the category of each showing.
