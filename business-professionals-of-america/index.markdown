Business Professionals of America is an extracurricular business competition for high school students. In 2013, three other students and I competed in an event called Small Business Management Team. We were given a case study and acted as consultants for the owner of a struggling sporting goods store owner.

The product of our work for the event is the brand we created, Mammoth Action Sports. Mammoth Action Sports is a sporting goods store located in Mammoth Lakes, California that specializes in the apparel niche. The company logo and a picture of our team at nationals is shown below. For more information about the project, check out the PowerPoint presentation we gave and the Excel sheet with our financial analysis below.
