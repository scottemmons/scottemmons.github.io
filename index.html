    <p><blockquote>To myself I am only a child playing on the beach, while vast oceans of truth lie undiscovered before me. -- Isaac Newton</blockquote></p>

    <p>I know how Newton felt! I am fascinated by the world around me, and I have deep desire not just to know things, but to understand them. I love to learn, and I am interested in a wide variety of topics ranging from history to technology. If not quite as well as Isaac Newton, I enjoy asking questions and attempting to grasp the big ideas of many subjects.</p>
    
    <p>I am particularly interested in business and computer science. I'm taking every opportunity I can both in and out of school to learn about these fields and work on meaningful projects within them. If you'd like to learn more about what I'm working on, take a look at my projects page.</p>
    
    <p>As a proud member of Hoosier Nation, one of my greatest hobbies is watching and playing basketball. I'm a distance runner you'll find running 5K's with his mom, a drummer you'll find air drumming to his favorite jazz songs, and a self-proclaimed skit master you'll find performing at local talent shows.</p>
