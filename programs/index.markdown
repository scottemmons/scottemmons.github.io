**[Stocks](https://github.com/scottemmons/Stocks)**

I wrote Stocks as a tool for investors. In its current state, it is a framework for pulling stock data and running basic sorting algorithms based on that data. Users can interact with the environment to pull data quickly on their favorite stocks, or they can run the built-in sorting analyses on a list of companies for a stat-based ranking.

This tool was designed as a supplement to investors to help with research. It is not meant to be an investing guide or to provide investing advice.

**[Matrices](https://github.com/scottemmons/Matrices)**

I wrote Matrices one weekend when my math teacher assigned dozens of problems involving matrices for homework. I found writing and using the program much more enjoyable than doing the homework with paper and pencil. Currently, the primary functionality of the program is to put a matrix into reduced row echelon form.

**[Space Invaders](https://github.com/scottemmons/Space_Invaders)**

A Pygame remake of the classic arcade game. It is still in development status.

I have done my best to maintain the look, feel, and spirit of the original game.Currently, users can control their ship to fire at and kill the aliens; the aliens will move in rows and fire back. I have yet to implement gameflow logic, score keeping, and barriers.
