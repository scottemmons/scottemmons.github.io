On one side is the humanities camp. English majors, musicians, philosophers, and artists band together to defend the classics. They argue that liberal arts courses are necessary for the development of the human experience; students would be incomplete as humans without taking them.

On the other side is the hard sciences camp. Mathematicians, scientists, engineers, and computer programmers preach STEM careers. They say that quantitative, analytical thinking is the future of the workforce; students would be unprepared for jobs without taking classes in the sciences.

Students are caught in the middle. The boy who loves poetry is advised to drop English and take up Java—the latter language is more employable. The girl who loves biology is required to study Shakespeare—the human experience only can be understood through literature, not meiosis.

Teachers feel surrounded. The Latin teacher is reminded by employers that her language is dead. The calculus teacher is told his subject is cold and distant from students’ lives. All teachers face one question of students: “When will we ever use this?”

“What role should the liberal arts play in education?” has sparked a battlefield, and each side has dug a trench to defend a position. The motives of each side are noble, but trench warfare doesn’t lead to progress. All it does is wear morale and mount casualties.

This debate is rooted in the assumption that what is taught can either be fulfilling to students as humans or practical to their future careers, but not both. Underlying that assumption is the belief that the humanities are impractical and the hard sciences cannot touch on a human level. Both of these assumptions are false.

In today’s economy the humanities are more important than ever. We are purpose-seeking creatures, and studies are revealing that meaning, not money, lies at the root of productivity. A company full of technical talent, but without a purpose, has no place in today’s market. Employees will be unmotivated, consumers won’t buy into the product, and the company will go under. Design, story, symphony, empathy, play, and meaning are identified by Daniel Pink in A Whole New Mind as “fundamental human abilities” necessary for career success. Humanities will lead the companies of tomorrow. 

Likewise, the hard sciences are grounded in humanity’s search for meaning; they have their foundation in man looking out at the world and asking why. Newton’s law of gravitation explains in abstract how apples should fall from trees, but that concept is meaningless without man, the observer. To wonder how an apple will fall from a tree, to ideate a scientific explanation, and to watch as the apple actually falls from the tree is a deeply human experience. “Who am I?”, the foundation of the humanities, depends on “what is the world?”, the foundation of the sciences. It is fitting that modern science’s ancestor, mythology, lives among the humanities today.

Is it possible for education to find a middle ground?

The question can only be answered on an individual basis.

“The salvation of this human world lies nowhere else than in the human heart, in the human power to reflect, in human meekness and in human responsibility. Without a global revolution in… human consciousness, nothing will change for the better,” said Vaclav Havel, who led the Velvet Revolution and was the first democratically elected president of the Czech Republic after it overcame Soviet rule.

Reform happens on an individual level. Parker Palmer says it well in The Courage to Teach: “Institutions reform slowly, and as long as we wait, depending on ‘them’ to do the job for us—forgetting that the institutions are also ‘us’—we merely postpone reform and continue the slow slide into cynicism that characterizes too many teaching careers.”

“No law is gonna change us—we have to change us,” the rapper Macklemore says concisely.

It is in the power of students and teachers alone to resolve the current conflict between the humanities and the hard sciences. Only by teaching such that our subjects have meaning and utility, and only by learning such that we are transformed both as people and as a workforce, will there be resolution. That’s why I want to be a professor when I’m older.

We must be the change we wish to see in the world.
