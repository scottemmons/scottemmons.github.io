This is my blog. I'll post what's on my mind here, which may concern business or computer science, education, current events, real-life updates, or general musings.

I'd love to hear from you! Take advantage of the comments section if you have any thoughts concerning a post, and don't hesitate to email me at _scott at scottemmons dot com_.
