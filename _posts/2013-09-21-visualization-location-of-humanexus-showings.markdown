I recently made the map shown below during my work as a research intern with the Cyberinfrastructure for Network Science Center (CNS). The lab's director, Katy Borner, produced a short film called [Humanexus](http://yfshen.info/humanexus/) about human communication throughout the ages. The map I made is a geospatial and topical visualization of all the film's showings. The location of each node tells where in the world a Humanexus showing occurred, and the color of each node denotes the category of each showing.

So far, almost everything I've learned about the topic of data visualization has been from CNS's free [Information Visualization MOOC](http://ivmooc.cns.iu.edu/). I made this map using a combination of the [Science of Science (Sci2) Tool](https://sci2.cns.iu.edu/user/index.php), a piece of data visualization software created by CNS, and Adobe Illustrator. I used Sci2 to plot the film's showing on a map of the world and Adobe Illustrator for post production.
