Hear me out; I'm sane, I promise.

I woke up this morning and did my regular morning routine. I walked downstairs, opened the fridge, and opened a Chobani yogurt for breakfast.

I found this.

The yogurt was talking: "It's hard to believe but there are three cups of milk in here."

The next day, it happened again.

"Welcome to preservative-free yogurt made with only natural ingredients."

And again.

"Finally, a 100 calorie yogurt worth counting."

Jokes aside, Chobani now delivers a marketing message to me every time I eat a cup of its yogurt.

Marketing on a product's container isn't new. Packaging is filled with health facts and product slogans, and is part of the reason consumers buy products in the first place.

Chobani's strategy is different. I call it "talking yogurt" because the message feels like it comes directly from the yogurt. This sensation is due to the placement of the message.

Chobani chose to place its key message directly on the inside of the lid. As a consumer, I immediately noticed the message--a recent development in the product--for two reasons.

First, I always look at the inside of the lid in order to scrape the yogurt that is stuck to it back into the cup. Chobani's inside-the-lid message is an advertising placement consumers are guaranteed to see if they eat the yogurt.

Second, there is no noise for the inside of the yogurt lid to compete with. For me, the absence of noise is literal; I eat the yogurt each morning for breakfast, and I am alone in a quiet house. The absence of noise is also logistical; nothing else is written on the inside of the lid.

So how has Chobani chosen to utilize "talking yogurt", this valuable advertising opportunity of inside-the-lid yogurt messages?

With simple, one-sentence messages designed to increase brand loyalty.

They're short enough to be remembered, concern substantive facts to pack a punch, and aim to cultivate loyal customers and repeat product purchases.

Awesome.
