Over the past few months, I've been working with fellow students, teachers, and administrators to found a program at our school that we call the Life Skills Academy. This week it was approved by administration and is set to run the upcoming fall semester. I will be the founder and president.

Roughly 30% of North's students are failing one or more classes. They have no discipline problems, so they are never sent to the office, but they are unable to meet the demands of their high school courses. They fail in silence, and our school has no response system in place to help them succeed.

The goal of the Life Skills Academy is to reach out to students who are failing one or more core classes, such as English or Algebra, which they need to graduate. None of these students lack the mental capacity to pass these classes; rather, they lack lifestyle habits and an environment of support.

The Life Skills Academy will provide intensive help to selected students, whom we call cadets, by pairing them with two coaches, one academic- and one lifestyle-coach.  The coaches will provide focused support, both in terms of coursework and lifestyle, to the students who need it most. There will be multiple hours of in-school time each week dedicated to this purpose.

The message to failing students is clear: you're going to succeed, and we're here to make it happen.

I firmly believe the Life Skills Academy will change lives. It will reach students in North's building who have never been reached before, and it will teach them skills that will be a foundation for success throughout the rest of their lives. It will also provide students such as myself with an opportunity to grow through service. I'm thrilled at the opportunity to teach, which I hope to continue the rest of my life as a professor.

North's students and faculty are not the only ones invested in the success of the Life Skills Academy. National leaders in research and education have provided support for the program. They include:

-- Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor, a neuroscientist who has given [TED Talks](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzT_SBl31-s) on the adolescent mind, who has worked as an advisor to develop the program;

-- [The Hawn Foundation](http://thehawnfoundation.org/mindup/mindup-curriculum/), an organization that provides training and curriculum for K-8 schools on emotional and psychological well-being, which is looking to use the Life Skills Academy as a pilot for a high school version of its curriculum;

-- And the [Marzano Research Lab](http://www.marzanoresearch.com/), which has expressed interest in using the Life Skills Academy as the basis for an action research project to clinically assess the impact of the program on the achievement of struggling students.

I am very excited about the potential of this program; it is literally life-changing.

I'll conclude with the same message I gave at the program's callout meeting last Friday:

Welcome to the club.
