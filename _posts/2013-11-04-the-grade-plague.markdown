What is a successful education? In an age during which education is more important than ever, there are a variety of meaningful ways in which an individual could answer this question. However, the American school system reduces all the possibilities of education into one definition of success: grades and standardized test scores.

This test-driven definition of success is deeply rooted in the school system. Schools are assessed based on their standardized test scores. Students receive credits and are ranked in their graduating class based on nothing more than grade point averages and test scores. Teachers' primary--and often only--goal is to have their students pass their class.

Yet the prevailing definition of success is hollow; it works in opposition to learning and deprives students of a sense of purpose.

Education is not to reform students or amuse them or to make them expert technicians, said Robert Maynard Hutchins, President of the University of Chicago from 1929-52. It is to unsettle their minds, widen their horizons, inflame their intellects, teach them to think straight, if possible. The hallmarks of true learning are intellectual curiosity and exploration, but the test-focused structure of schools undermines both of these ideals.

For example, take the problem of finding the area of a triangle. If a student is given a triangular piece of paper and asked to find its area, her natural curiosity will lead her to start exploring the problem. She may try folding the paper, sketching new triangles, or talking to her classmates about possible solutions. Eventually, she would come up with a theory and eagerly seek to prove it, using her own reasoning to validate her claims. She might come up with the correct solution, realizing that a triangle of a certain base and height is exactly half of a rectangle with the length and width of the same dimensions, or she might not. Either way, she will have participated in a real intellectual pursuit and come away with a greater understanding and appreciation for the problem at hand.

School's definition of success actively discourages this kind of true learning in school. In math class, problems are answered almost as soon as they are posed, leaving students little time to think about them. In the above example, a teacher would begin the lesson by saying, To find the area of a triangle, use the formula  * base * height. Then, she would give students worksheets with lots of triangles for which to find the area. More often than not, the students would simply memorize the formula and plug in the numbers for every problem on the worksheet, having little understanding of what they were calculating or why they were calculating it.

And why should they? Their only assessment will be a test. On the test, they will find yet more triangles and be asked to find their areas. The formula for the area of a triangle is easy to memorize and mindlessly use, and by doing so the students will receive a perfect test score and be heralded by the school system as successful students and by society as smart kids.

By the same logic, why should the students' teacher strive to create a real intellectual relationship with her students? She has been given a curriculum--a long list of skills students should acquire such as finding the area of a triangle--by the state, and she will be assessed based on the students' test scores at the end of the year. Having the students actually learn through inquiry and discovery would take more time and effort than rote memorization and regurgitation of the material, and would ultimately lead to no better results.

In this way, as opposed to engaging in mutual exploration and discovery of new ideas, teachers and students spend their time preparing to pass the test. Thus, as a direct result of the test-driven mindset of schools, learning becomes a tragic game students and teachers must play.

Even more tragic, the schools' test-driven mindset deprives students of purpose.

What is purpose? In her article Driven to succeed: How we're depriving teens of a sense of purpose, Terri Lobdell defines purpose as ¦ a stable and generalized intention to accomplish something that is at the same time meaningful to the self and consequential for the world beyond the self. In other words, purpose has two parts: it must be purposefully meaningful, and it must have an impact on the world. The current state of the school system promotes neither of these things.

Students are unable to make school personally meaningful because they are never asked to create their own definitions of success. Instead, school and society force them into rigid and often meaningless goals. Students are told to work long and hard for good grades, but often that work consists of little more than learning rules and facts to pass a test; and because classes are confined to the test, rarely do students have the freedom to explore the value that the subject material may have to their lives.

Indeed, because teachers are so focused on ensuring that students can pass the test, they often actively discourage the kinds of deeper exploration that make a subject valuable to students. Students who would like to dive deeper are told: Don't worry, that's not on the test, That knowledge is outside the scope of the class, or We don't have time to go into that right now. How should a student stay motivated and make a subject meaningful when What is an engaged student to do but give up when she meets that kind of brick-wall resistance?

Furthermore, the work done in most high school classes has no ¦ consequen[ce] for the world beyond the self. It is an old adage of students to ask, When are we ever going to use this? and they are right. In most classes, the assignments have little applicability outside the scope of the class. How can a student possibly view an assignment such as coloring in the parts of a cell useful? Or taking detailed notes over every section of a chapter? Or memorizing the steps required to turn a matrix into reduced row echelon form? Because the school system has become so infatuated with its own definition of success, it believes that any assignment worth points--and thus contributing to a grade--is valuable, whether or not it impacts the world.

Some would argue that while the school system is not perfect, it is far from broken. Yes, grades are an imperfect measurement of learning, they'd say, but they are a necessary metric to evaluate basic competencies such as reading, writing, and arithmetic. And they're right. Tests are a great way to measure basic competencies in students.

The problem is that tests have become so much more than a basic metric. As far as school is concerned, they have become the sole goal of learning. The focus in the classroom has shifted from expanding knowledge, exploring concepts, and sharing ideas to passing tests. Used correctly, tests could be an occasional event to make sure students are on the right track. Today, they have swamped students' natural curiosity and sense of purpose.

Many students today put forth massive amounts of effort to get good grades. They take detailed notes in class, do all of their homework assignments, and ace all of their tests. Look at a successful student's transcript, and it will be filled with good grades in every subject. It's too bad that those grades reflect little true learning and lack a sense of purpose.
