I recently joined the [Cyberinfrastructure for Network Science Center](http://cns.iu.edu/) (CNS) as a research intern.

The CNS is an informatics research lab at Indiana University directed by Dr. Katy Borner. The lab's work centers around data visualization, using images to better understand big data. Three primary projects in the lab include creating data visualization tools, developing an online course to teach the public how to use the tools, and performing research with the tools.

My work is focused on the latter two projects. I'm currently learning from the center's [Information Visualization MOOC](http://ivmooc.cns.iu.edu/), helping to develop the class through my feedback, and creating my own visualizations.

As a young academic interested in computer science, I'm excited for the opportunity to contribute to the research lab. I'll keep you updated!
