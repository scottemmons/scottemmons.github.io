What is the purpose of higher education?

In a time when a college degree is more necessary, and expensive, than ever, this question is pressing for both students and educators alike.

I recently came across [an interview](http://www.keyreporter.org/PbkNews/PbkNews/Details/691.html) with a writing professor at MIT, Junot Diaz, that addresses this issue. The final question Diaz is asked is, What do you think is the value of studying liberal arts¦ at the college level? Here is his reply:

We live in a time where everything is monetized. Where every student at university is told that they should be practical”that they should only study that which will lead directly to a job.¦ These days universities have been deranged by the logic of the cash nexus, by the corporate ethos which seeks to extract profit from everything¦. In the liberal arts we're trying to humanize people in a culture that does everything to turn them into cogs. I can't imagine a more valuable practice or study than that. Hey, everybody loves money but being a full human being ain't a bad thing either.

To me, the most striking aspect of this response is the gap it highlights between the needs of the workforce and the current college curriculum of many programs. This gap is assumed in the premise of Diaz's argument”students must choose between a liberal arts education”humanization”or a more practical major”one that leads directly to a job.

This gap shouldn't exist; the purpose of higher education should be multifold.

As Diaz says, college should teach students more about themselves and the world for the sake of knowledge. There is no more valuable practice or study than that.

But higher education should also prepare students to get a job. College is the last formal instruction students receive before entering the workforce; if they want a sustainable future, students need to be prepared to earn a living.

With the ever-increasing costs of higher education, students can't afford _not_ to be able to make a living upon graduating. According to CNN Money, two-thirds of the class of 2011 graduated with student debt, and on average each borrower owed $26,600.

The current gap between many programs and the workforce ignores the reality of students' futures. Students who seek employable degrees are not ¦deranged by the logic of the cash nexus, but only looking out for their futures.

To fix this gap between higher education and the workforce, leaders in academia must recognize the responsibility they have in preparing students for their futures. Yes, students should be exposed to the arts, but they should also be trained for a job after graduation. I'm sure that colleges can find a way to make students both full human beings and employable.
