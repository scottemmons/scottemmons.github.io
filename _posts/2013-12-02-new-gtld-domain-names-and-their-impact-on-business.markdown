A variety of new domain names, called gTLD extensions, are scheduled for release in the near future.

This post covers the most relevant information about these new domains and how they will impact your business.


# **What is a domain name, anyway?**




Domains serve a functional purpose on the internet. When a user enters a URL, the browser searches for the location of the website based on the domain name it is registered under.

In this way domains are more than just a name. They are a physical part of the infrastructure that makes up the internet.


# **Could my business create a custom domain name, i.e. .custom?**




At least for the moment, the infrastructure to support a custom domain name is expensive ($185,000-type expensive.) Most likely your business will need to take advantage of the pre-existing custom domains that are to be released.


# **Some general information about the new domains**




The new domains will be released in three types: closed, restricted, and open.

Closed domains will be owned by an institution for its exclusive use. For example, Google could create .google.

Restricted domains will be open to any company that meets the domain-specific registration criteria. Many of these domains will be geographic, such as .london which will be open to businesses in London.

Open domains will be open to any registrant in the same way the .com domain is open today.


# **When and how will these new domains be released?**




It has been difficult for me to find an exact answer to this question. It appears that ICANN, the official distributor of domain names and URLs, will be slowly releasing new domains periodically over the next few months / year. Many sites such as GoDaddy claim they are coming soon, but your guess is as good as mine on what that means.


# **Will the new domains make a big impact? How important will they be for businesses in practice?**




I can't imagine that new domain names are going to revolutionize the internet overnight. If only because it will take people time to adjust, .com URLs will remain popular for a while.

However, new domains do have the power to change the way the internet _functions_. Geographical domains such as .newyork could change the way consumers search for products, giving them tremendous value.


# **How should my business best prepare for these new domains?**




Currently sites like GoDaddy give users the option to Pre-Register on select domains, which will improve your chances of getting your domain by pre-registering it _before_ it is generally available.

The pre-registration costs ~$50, which isn't nothing. It also isn't a guarantee of the name. More than one person can pre-register for the same domain, and an auction will decide the final owner at the time of release.

Most new domains are not even available for pre-registration yet. Your business should sign up to Follow the domains it wants, meaning that GoDaddy will send out information when pre-registration for them becomes available.


# **How much will the new domains cost?**




The pricing for many of the new domains is still to be determined.


# **Businesses Aren't Limited to One Domain**




For example, a restaurant in New York may want .food and .nyc.


# **Trademarks Will be Protected**




Trademark owners will have the opportunity to register their name before the general public.
