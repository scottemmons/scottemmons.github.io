I'm a research intern at the Cyberinfrastructure for Network Science Center (CNS). We recently held our open house, a public event at which we shared our recent work with the public.

The open house featured presentations, displays, and an animated film. I gave a 5-minute presentation on my current work, which I call mapping the consumer landscape based on demographics. Other speakers discussed the [Scholarly Database](http://sdb.cns.iu.edu/), the [Information Visualization MOOC](http://ivmooc.cns.iu.edu/), [AcademyScope](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdqKBna1Fos), and [CourseNetworking](http://www.thecn.com/).

The Indiana Daily Student ran [an article](http://www.idsnews.com/news/story.aspx?id=95234) about the event, and CNS [posted pictures](http://cns.iu.edu/open_house.html).

It is important for a university to be integrated in its surrounding community. Public events are an excellent way to encourage community interaction and involvement with current university research. I was particularly happy to present at the open house because I shared my work not only with other researchers but also the community.
