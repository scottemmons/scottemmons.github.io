_Never make absolute statements._


As a high school student I've been through a variety of English classes that teach writing. In all of them, teachers have made absolute statements about writing, but none of them have held universally true.

Writing classes are full of structural rules to follow. One of the earliest I learned is the topic sentence: Every paragraph should start with a sentence that lets the reader know what the paragraph is about. A little later, I was taught the concluding statement: End each paragraph with a sentence that sums up the point you wish to make. Then, the five-paragraph essay: Each paper should have five paragraphs: an introduction that introduces the reader to your topic and arguments, three body paragraphs that support those arguments, and a conclusion summing up your arguments.

In addition to structural rules, a variety of little writing tips have been thrown at me. Use the active voice whenever possible, I was told. In addition, Never use the first person. It weakens the argument you are making. And, Don't start a sentence with a conjunction; if you want to use a conjunction, add it on to the end of the previous sentence.

By thinking of writing as a set of rules”a form to be followed and a set of expectations to be met to the letter”I lost sight of what is important in writing. Instead of putting content before form, I got caught up in the number of paragraphs in my writing. I spent my time worrying about the first person as opposed to thinking of writing as a tool through which to deliver a voice. The rules, though meant well, ultimately handicapped me from producing authentic writing.

The underlying problem with these writing rules is that they are absolute. By following absolute statements about the nature of writing, writers fail to recognize the nuances that exist in any work. The statements limit a writer's field of view and thus blind them, killing potential art before it can flourish.

We must be careful about absolutes; they are dangerous. They make an over-simplification of the world, and in their desire to show a black-and-white picture deprive life of its color.
