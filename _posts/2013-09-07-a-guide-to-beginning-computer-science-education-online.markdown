If you'd like to learn about computer science, there are countless free resources available to you online. This guide will introduce you to what's out there.

**Online Courses**

Recent years have seen an explosion in MOOC's, or massive open online courses. These online courses are a great way to begin learning in a structured environment. They provide online lectures, homework assignments, assessments, and additional resources.

[MIT's 6.00 Introduction to Computer Science and Programming](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-00sc-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-spring-2011/index.htm) is taught in Python and is an excellent introductory course. While Python is a powerful and versatile language, its syntax is easy to pick up which enables students to focus on programming concepts without worrying much about semantic details. This course is the first one I took online, and I highly recommend it. The concepts taught in the course are universally applicable to problem solving and will transfer to any other programming language one uses in the future.

[Harvard's CS50](https://www.cs50.net/) is another excellent introduction to computer science taught in C. Because C is a lower-level language than Python, the class emphasizes the workings of a computer more than 6.00's higher-level conceptual approach. I also highly recommend this course, which can be taken alongside MIT's 6.00.

[Stanford's Programming Methodology](http://see.stanford.edu/see/courseinfo.aspx?coll=824a47e1-135f-4508-a5aa-866adcae1111) is an introduction to computer science taught in Java. This class provides a framework for thinking about programming, and the instructor is truly amazing.

In addition, [MIT's OpenCourseWare](ocw.mit.edu/) and [Stanford's Engineering Everywhere](see.stanford.edu/) have a variety of courses pursuing more advanced topics in computer science.

**Online Textbooks**

There are tons of free computer science texts online. These are a great way to supplement online courses, but they can also be used as stand-alone classes as many have both lessons and assignments.

[Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/) is the quintessential programming textbook. It offers a conceptual foundation to the entire field of computer science, and can be paired with its online course [6.001 Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/) on MIT's OpenCourseWare. Read [Why SICP Matters](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~bh/sicp.html), a short essay by UC Berkeley professor Brian Harvey, if you'd like to learn more about why the textbook is held in such high regard.

[How to Design Programs, Second Edition](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/HtDP2e/) is another foundational computer science textbook. Here is some [great discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6150967) about the book.

[Learn Python the Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/) and [Think Python](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/) are two Python textbooks. The former offers a hands-on approach to programming, and the latter has good explanation of basic concepts in Python.

**Interactive Websites**

[Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/) is the most famous interactive learning tool. It is a great way to get your feet wet writing code, but I'd look to other places for a comprehensive overview of computer science concepts.

**More Resources**

Check out [edX](https://www.edx.org/), [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/), [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/), [Academic Earth](http://academicearth.org/), and [Class Central](http://www.class-central.com/) for more online classes.

See [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) to search for and ask programming questions, and visit[Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/news)for thoughtful computer science discussion.
