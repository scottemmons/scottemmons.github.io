![President McRobbie and First Lady](/assets/President-McRobbie.png) I got the opportunity to attend yesterday's IU football game in the presidential suite. The accommodations were comfortable, the view was spectacular, but best of all I was able to meet and talk to President Michael McRobbie and his wife Laurie McRobbie. They were very kind and made me, a high school student, feel at home in a room full of distinguished university alumni. I'm glad I could talk to them and wish them both the best.
