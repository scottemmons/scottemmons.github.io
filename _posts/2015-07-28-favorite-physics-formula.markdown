"What's your favorite physics formula?" a friend of mine once asked me.

My first thought was, "A favorite physics formula? Who has a favorite physics formula?"

Then I realized that <i>I</i> have a favorite physics formula.

My favorite physics formula is the displacement over time of a projectile undergoing constant acceleration. (See image.) To me, the formula is striking because it encapsulates all of physics.

It is fundamental to human nature to be curious. Why is the sky blue? What causes the wind? Why do objects fall to earth? My favorite formula answers the question, "How far will a thrown ball travel?" Such questions are easy to ask but impossible to answer without the tools of physics.

The first challenge is figuring out how this question can even be answered. Colloquialisms such as "The ball will travel a little ways in the direction it was thrown," and "The ball will rise briefly, then fall," are interesting but too imprecise to be scientifically meaningful.

To overcome this challenge we must define what we mean by "a little ways" and "briefly." To do so we define standard units of measurement (meters, seconds) and express those values numerically. The definition of units for quantitative measurement—assumed to be independent of the studied system—may seem trivial but is in fact profound. In modern physics, the relativity of simultaneity has blown open the assumption of an independent "clock" counting time with significant implications. For our discussion, this effect is negligible and meters and seconds prove instrumental to analyzing a ball's trajectory.

The second challenge is providing a complete description of the path of the ball. It is simple to make partial descriptions of the ball's path: "The ball will travel four meters in the direction it was thrown" or "The ball will be in the air for 4 seconds." However, these statements just lead to more questions. At what time does the ball reach its maximum height? How high in the air is the ball after one second, or two seconds? How far has it travelled after a given increment of time?

That is where the power of my favorite equation comes into play. It describes the ball's motion in terms of any increment of time. If we would like to know where the ball is at a given number of seconds, we simply plug in that amount of time and calculate the result. In effect, the physics formula is an infinite amount of information packaged into a single mathematical expression.
 
With units, numbers, and equations, we can describe the motion of a thrown ball completely and precisely. That is the essence of physics: a mathematical description of physical reality. The problem of projectile motion illustrates it beautifully.

In the end, I am only left to wonder what it means that a mathematical invention—the parabola—describes physical reality. As Einstein said:

"The most incomprehensible thing about the universe is that it is comprehensible."
